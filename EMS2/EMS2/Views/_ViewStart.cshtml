@*Code that needs to run before each view or page should be placed in the _ViewStart.cshtml file
By convention, the _ViewStart.cshtml file is located in the Pages (or Views) folder.
The statements listed in _ViewStart.cshtml are run before every full view (not layouts, and not partial views).*@

@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
